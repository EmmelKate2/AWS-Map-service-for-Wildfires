# AWS-Map-service-for-Wildfires
For class in BootcampGIS
This Repository stores practice notebooks, data, and project ideas for my class in AWS map service making for Wildfires. The Capstone File contains my notebooks for the Holiday Farm Fire
which I prepared raster data for. My data is sourced from USGS Earth explorer.
